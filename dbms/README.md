## Getting Started

Welcome to the Clothing Retail Store DBMS Application. 


## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders, where:

1) `src`: the folder to maintain sources
    > This folder contains App.java which will be executed in order to run the application.
2) `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
    > This folder contains a .jar file called "ojdbc8.jar", which must be added to the classpath in order to connect to the Oracle database system. 


## Instructions

1) Download the Java package or clone the repository on a local computer.
2) If not on TMU lab computers, connect to the OpenVPN. Otherwise, skip this step.
3) Add ojdbc8.jar file from dbms\lib to the classpath of the project.
4) Run the App.java file.
