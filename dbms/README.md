## Getting Started

Welcome to the Clothing Retail Store DBMS Application. 


## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders, where:

1) `src`: the folder to maintain sources
    > This folder contains App.java which will be executed in order to run the application.
2) `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
    > This folder contains a .jar file called "ojdbc8.jar", which must be added to the classpath in order to connect to the Oracle database system. 


## Instructions

1) Download the Java package or clone the repository on a local computer.
2) Connect to an Oracle database.
3) Open Eclipse and add this project to your workspace.
4) Add ojdbc8.jar file from dbms\lib to the classpath of the project.
